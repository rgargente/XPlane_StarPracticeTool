# XPlane_StarPracticeTool

StarPracticeTool is a plugin for X Plane 11. It helps you set up a flight to practice standard arrival procedures.

The main features are:
- It works both with default X Plane nav data or with updated cycles. It automatically reads the newest one so that  it remains consistent with the simulator.
- It doesn't need any external application or data. If you fly an aircraft with an FMC this is all you need to set up your STAR.
- You can easily practice several different STARS, or the same one multiple times, without long loading times between flights.
- Let's you choose your starting altitude and speed.
- Smooth transition between different states. Practice flights start with a reasonable stable aircraft.
- Builtin notification when a new version is released.

## Installation

This plugin is implemented with Python and therefore requires the PythonInterface plugin for X Plane. You can get from here: http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface.htm

Copy the contents of the zip package inside XPlane/Resources/plugins/PythonScripts

After that you will find a new menu option inside X Plane, in the plugins menu.
